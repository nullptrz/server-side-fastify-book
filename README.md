# Accelerating Server-Side Development with Fastify

This repo will contain all the code files that I code along while following the book presented below. The main branch will contain all the code
along as-is, whereas the branches will represent some experiments I conduct out of curiosity based on a topic. The goal is to really understand
server side applications and master fastify framework.
